# Password Genrator

## 1. Demonstrated proficiency in React.js concepts and best practices, including controlled components and functional components.

This project showcases my ability to develop user-friendly web applications using modern JavaScript frameworks, as well as my understanding of React.js fundamentals and React hooks. It highlights my skills in front-end development, including UI/UX design and state management, and demonstrates my commitment to delivering practical and innovative solutions.

## Feature : 
### Customizable String: Generate random strings with customizable options:
   ### Include integers in your string.
   ### Include special characters in your string.
   ### Generate strings up to 30 characters in length.
   ### Copy Functionality: Easily copy the generated string with a single click.
   ### Security: The generated random string is secure and protected, ensuring users cannot modify it manually as it is set to readOnly.
   
## Technique / Algorithm
### This React.js micro project utilizes the following techniques and algorithms:

#### 1. useState(): Utilized for managing password, passwordLength, isNumber inclusion, and isSpecialChar inclusion
#### 2. useCallback(): Employed for calling methods of the passwordGenerator.
#### 3. useEffect(): Implemented to change and regenerate passwords on three different events.
#### 4. useRef(): Used for copying the generated password.

## Technique Explanation:
### The core functionality of this application revolves around a method called passwordGenerator(), which generates a random string based on the user's input parameters. By leveraging React hooks such as useState(), useCallback(), useEffect(), and useRef(), we ensure efficient state management, controlled component updates, and seamless user interaction.


## Usage:
### 1. Select the desired options for your random string (including integers, special characters, and length).
### 2. Click the "Generate" button to create a random string based on your preferences.
### 3. Click the "Copy" button to quickly copy the generated string to your clipboard for easy use.

## About: 
### This React.js micro project showcases the power and versatility of React hooks in building interactive and user-friendly web applications. By providing users with the ability to customize and generate random strings securely, it offers practical utility while demonstrating fundamental React.js concepts.

## Get Start:
### To explore and experiment with this project:
### 1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
### 2. Install dependencies using npm or yarn.
### 3. Run the development server.
### 4. Start generating your own random strings with ease!

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
